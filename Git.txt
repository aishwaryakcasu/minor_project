Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in source code
during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become the standard
for version control in the software development industry.

Git is known for its speed, flexibility, and the ability to handle both small and large projects effectively.
It is a cornerstone of modern software development practices, enabling collaboration, version tracking, and 
efficient management of codebases. Popular hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide additional
features and tools that integrate with Git for collaborative development.
